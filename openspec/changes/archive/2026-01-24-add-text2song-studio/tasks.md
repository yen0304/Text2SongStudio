## Dependencies

- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 and Phase 2 (prompts required for generation)
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 (audio required for feedback)
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 4 (feedback required for datasets)
- Phase 6 can proceed in parallel with Phases 4-5
- Phase 7 depends on Phase 5 and Phase 6
- Phase 8 depends on all previous phases

## Parallelizable Work

Within each phase, frontend and backend tasks can often proceed in parallel:
- Phase 2: Tasks 2.1-2.3 (backend) parallel with 2.4-2.5 (frontend)
- Phase 3: Tasks 3.1-3.7 (backend) parallel with 3.8-3.10 (frontend)
- Phase 4: Tasks 4.1-4.3 (backend) parallel with 4.4-4.6 (frontend)
